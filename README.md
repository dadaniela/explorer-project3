Explorer is a series of different projects to learn web development from HTML and CSS to JS and ReactJS

### Project 03
This project is the continuation of some HTML and CSS concepts from Project 02 and the introduction to new HTML elements such as fieldset and legend and how to customize them. I learned how to create forms with different input types and also how to validate and style them with a11y in mind.
