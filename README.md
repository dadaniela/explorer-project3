Explorer is a series of different projects I’m building to learn web development from HTML and CSS to JS and ReactJS whilst also practicing UX/UI design and accessibility concepts.
It’s one of the courses offered by [rocketseat.com.br](https://rocketseat.com.br)

### Project 03
This project is the continuation of some HTML and CSS concepts from Project 02 and the introduction to new HTML elements such as fieldset and legend and how to customize them. I learned how to create forms with different input types and also how to validate and style them with a11y in mind.
